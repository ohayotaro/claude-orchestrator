## Architecture Decisions

### ADR-001: Orchestrator Pattern
- **Decision**: Claude Code delegates, does not implement
- **Rationale**: Conserve 1M context for coordination; leverage specialized models

### ADR-002: Dual Language Stack
- **Decision**: Python for analysis/backtesting, MQL5 for EA execution
- **Rationale**: Python has superior data science ecosystem; MQL5 is required for MetaTrader

### ADR-003: Data Format
- **Decision**: Parquet for storage, DataFrame for processing
- **Rationale**: Parquet offers columnar compression and fast I/O; pandas/polars interop

### ADR-004: Hook-Driven Routing
- **Decision**: Python hooks intercept tool calls to suggest AI routing
- **Rationale**: Enforcement at tool-call level is more reliable than prompt instructions alone

### ADR-005: Multi-Strategy as First-Class Concern (2026-05-14)
- **Decision**: Scaffolded projects treat strategies as first-class, isolated, registry-managed units. Identity is a `strategy_id` of the form `<venue>.<market>.<logic_slug>.<symbol>.<timeframe>.v<major>`. The canonical source of truth is `config/registry.toml`, written only by `/strategy-register`. Default runtime model is one process / container per strategy with per-strategy config, SQLite, and JSONL log.
- **Rationale**: The previous implicit model ("one project = one strategy") forced file rewrites whenever a new strategy was added or switched, broke audit trails, and made cross-strategy risk impossible to enforce. A registry-driven model lets the orchestrator scaffold N strategies without touching each other's files, gives a deterministic MagicNumber allocation for MQL5, and creates the seam needed for a cross-strategy risk aggregator service.
- **Skills affected**: new `/strategy-register`; `init-finance`, `strategy-design`, `bot-develop`, `ea-generate`, `bot-deploy`, `bot-monitor`, `risk-report` updated to consume / write registry. Contract lives in `.claude/rules/multi-strategy.md`.
- **MagicNumber allocation**: range `20_000_000`-`89_999_999` reserved for orchestrator. Initial candidate is `20M + (crc32(strategy_id) mod 70M)`; on collision the `magic_salt` field is incremented and the hash recomputed. Final value is frozen in the registry; EA reads it from a `.set` preset rather than hardcoding.
- **Risk aggregation**: separate `src/risk/aggregator.py` service, scoped per `risk_group`, reconciling against exchange/broker state every 60s. Soft cap freezes new entries across the group; hard cap flatten-and-halts.
- **Forward compatibility**: per-strategy SQLite is the default backend behind the `StateStore` protocol; future migration to a central operational DB (e.g. PostgreSQL) is possible without changing skill contracts, as long as bots respect the protocol.
- **Lifecycle gates**: `draft -> testnet -> live -> deprecated -> retired`, no backward transitions. Only `/bot-deploy` may promote to `live`, after the six preconditions defined in `multi-strategy.md` section 4. The daily live-trading acknowledgment in `.claude/state/live-trading-*.ack` remains an independent human gate enforced by the existing hook.
- **Open follow-ups**: schema migration policy when `registry.toml` `schema_version` is bumped; CI audit step (`/strategy-register audit`) wiring; reference implementation of `src/orchestrator/registry.py` and `src/risk/aggregator.py` (currently scaffolded as stubs by `/init-finance`).
