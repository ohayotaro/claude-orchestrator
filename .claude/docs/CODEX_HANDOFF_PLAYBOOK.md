# Codex Handoff Playbook

Templates for delegating tasks to Codex CLI.

## 1. Strategy Design Review

```bash
codex exec "
You are reviewing a trading strategy design for a financial trading system.

## Strategy
{paste strategy description}

## Review Checklist
1. Statistical edge validity — does the stated edge have theoretical/empirical support?
2. Overfitting risk — parameter count, IS/OOS gap, data snooping potential
3. Market regime dependency — will this fail in trending/ranging/volatile conditions?
4. Implementation feasibility — can this be implemented efficiently in Python and MQL5?
5. Risk controls — are stop loss, position sizing, and max drawdown properly defined?

Provide your assessment with confidence levels (High/Medium/Low) for each item.
"
```

## 2. Backtest Statistical Validation

```bash
codex exec "
Validate the statistical significance of these backtest results:

## Results
{paste backtest metrics}

## Validation Tasks
1. Calculate p-value for the Sharpe ratio (H0: Sharpe = 0)
2. Bootstrap 95% confidence interval for annual return
3. Run White's Reality Check for data snooping bias
4. Compare IS vs OOS performance gap
5. Assess parameter stability across sub-periods

Flag any signs of overfitting or look-ahead bias.

```

## 3. MQL5 EA Code Review

```bash
codex exec "
Review this MQL5 Expert Advisor code:

## Code
{paste EA code}

## Review Focus
1. Order management correctness — CTrade usage, OrderSend validation
2. Memory leak prevention — ArrayFree, indicator handle release
3. Error handling completeness — GetLastError after every operation
4. Slippage and spread handling — deviation parameters, spread checks
5. Magic number management — uniqueness, filtering
6. Risk control implementation — SL/TP, lot sizing, emergency stop

Provide specific line-by-line feedback.

"
```

## 7. Team Review — Final Judgment

Used by `/team-review` after parallel specialist reviews complete.

```bash
codex exec "
You are the senior reviewer for a financial trading codebase. Four specialist reviews have been collected. Render a final verdict.

## Specialist findings (verbatim)
### Security review
{paste security reviewer output}

### Quant correctness review
{paste quant reviewer output}

### Live reproducibility review
{paste reproducibility reviewer output}

### Performance review
{paste performance reviewer output}

## Decision tasks
1. Cross-cut: Are any specialist findings in conflict, or does the same root cause show up in multiple reviews?
2. Severity ranking: Re-rank ALL findings into Critical / High / Medium / Low with justification.
3. Ship/no-ship recommendation, with the minimum set of fixes required to ship.
4. Risks of shipping with each High/Critical finding unresolved.

Output as Markdown with sections matching the four tasks above.

```

## 8. Incident Root Cause Analysis

Used by `/incident-response` after emergency stop / postmortem.

```bash
codex exec --full-auto "
Analyze a trading bot incident and produce a postmortem.

## Incident
- Severity: {P0|P1|P2}
- Symptom: {what was observed}
- First detected at: {timestamp UTC}
- Bot: {strategy / symbol / venue}
- Action already taken: {emergency stop / kill switch / manual close}

## Evidence
- Logs (last N lines): {paste}
- Recent trades: {paste}
- Config at time of incident: {paste}

## Required output
1. Timeline reconstruction (event-by-event with UTC timestamps)
2. Most-likely root cause + evidence supporting it
3. Alternative root causes considered and ruled out
4. Immediate remediation steps (before re-enabling the bot)
5. Permanent fix proposal (code, config, or process)
6. Detection gap: how could this have been caught earlier?
7. Regression test that would catch this class of failure

Be explicit about what is verified vs. inferred.

```

## 9. IR Analysis Synthesis

Used by `/ir-analysis` after Gemini extracts data from PDFs / earnings calls.

```bash
codex exec "
Synthesize an investor-focused report from extracted IR materials.

## Company
{ticker / name / sector}

## Inputs (already extracted by Gemini)
- Annual report key figures: {paste table}
- Earnings call sentiment / quotes: {paste}
- Disclosures and risk factors: {paste}
- ESG / governance data: {paste}

## Required output
1. Bull case (3 bullets, each with supporting figure)
2. Bear case (3 bullets, each with supporting figure)
3. Key financial metrics table (multi-period: revenue growth, margins, FCF, ROE, leverage)
4. Forward-looking risks not covered by management
5. Peer comparison snapshot (versus 2-3 sector peers)
6. Verdict (overweight / market-weight / underweight) with confidence (High/Medium/Low) and the single observation that would flip the call

Cite the source section for every numeric claim.

```

## 10. Equity Screener Criteria Validation

Used by `/equity-screener` to sanity-check screening logic before running.

```bash
codex exec "
Validate this equity screening configuration before it runs against a market universe.

## Screen
{paste screen criteria — fundamental thresholds, technical filters, sector limits}

## Universe
{describe — e.g., TSE Prime, S&P 500, custom watchlist}

## Validation tasks
1. Survivorship / look-ahead: are any of these criteria using point-in-time-incorrect data (e.g., current-year EPS for a 2018 backtest)?
2. Correlation traps: which criteria are functionally redundant (e.g., P/E + EV/EBITDA + P/B all measuring 'value')?
3. Sector skew: would this screen structurally over-weight or under-weight any sector? Quantify if possible.
4. Edge cases: how does the screen handle missing values, recent IPOs, dual-class shares, ADRs?
5. Threshold sensitivity: which 1-2 thresholds, if perturbed by 10%, would most change the result set size?

Recommend specific config changes, with rationale.
"
```

## 11. Sector Rotation Logic Review

Used by `/sector-analysis` when a rotation strategy is being designed.

```bash
codex exec "
Review this sector rotation strategy for statistical and economic soundness.

## Rotation rules
{paste signals, scoring, rebalance frequency, sector universe}

## Backtest summary (if available)
{paste metrics}

## Review checklist
1. Macro regime conditioning: does the strategy implicitly bet on a single regime (rates up/down, growth/value)?
2. Lookback length: is the momentum / mean-reversion lookback consistent with academic evidence and avoids in-sample tuning?
3. Turnover and cost: at the stated rebalance frequency, what is the round-trip cost drag, and does the alpha survive it?
4. Sector definition stability: are sectors GICS-stable across the backtest window, or does reclassification create false signals?
5. Capacity: what AUM does this strategy break at, given typical sector ETF or stock-basket liquidity?
6. Drawdown character: are drawdowns concentrated in specific macro events (e.g., 2008, 2020-Q1)?

Flag any look-ahead or survivorship issues. Output confidence per item.
"
```

## 12. Optimization Result Validation

Used by `/optimize` after walk-forward / hyperparameter tuning completes.

```bash
codex exec "
Validate the output of a parameter optimization run.

## Run summary
- Strategy: {name}
- Search space: {parameters and ranges}
- Trials run: {N}
- Walk-forward windows: {IS/OOS configuration}
- Best parameters: {paste}
- IS / OOS metrics per window: {paste table}

## Validation tasks
1. Overfitting evidence: gap between IS and OOS Sharpe, parameter cluster vs. isolated peak, # effective parameters vs. # trades.
2. Parameter stability: are best parameters similar across walk-forward windows, or do they jump around?
3. Robustness: which best parameters lie on a flat region of the objective surface vs. a sharp peak (sharp = fragile)?
4. Multiple-comparison correction: given N trials, is the best Sharpe statistically distinguishable from chance? (Deflated Sharpe / White's Reality Check.)
5. Recommended next step: deploy / re-run with constraints / reject. State the deciding evidence.

Be quantitative — do not rely on visual intuition.

```

## 13. ML Pipeline Validation

Used by `/ml-pipeline` after model training / evaluation completes.

```bash
codex exec "
Validate an ML pipeline for a financial time-series problem.

## Pipeline summary
- Target: {classification / regression / ranking; horizon}
- Features: {list, with leakage-relevant notes}
- Train/val/test split: {dates, with purge / embargo configuration}
- Model: {family + key hyperparameters}
- Metrics: {paste — train, val, test, walk-forward}

## Validation tasks
1. Leakage audit: enumerate every feature; for each, confirm it is point-in-time-correct relative to the prediction timestamp.
2. Purge / embargo correctness: is the gap between train and val sufficient given the target horizon and feature lookback?
3. Train/test distribution drift: are val and test sampled from the same regime as train? Quantify drift if possible (KS test on key features).
4. Performance gap: is the train-vs-test gap consistent with healthy generalization, or with overfit / regime change?
5. Feature importance sanity: do the top features make economic sense, or does the model rely on suspicious proxies (e.g., date features, ID-like columns)?
6. Production readiness: what would need to change for live inference (latency, missing-feature handling, retraining cadence)?

Output: pass / conditional pass (with required fixes) / fail.
