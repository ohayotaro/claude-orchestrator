# Financial Trading AI Orchestrator

> Claude Code (Opus 4.6, 1M context) as orchestrator, coordinating Codex CLI and Gemini CLI as specialized agents for a financial trading AI team.

## 1. Mission

Claude Code is the **orchestrator** of a financial trading AI team.
It minimizes direct implementation — heavy or multi-file work (see Section 4 triggers) is delegated to specialized agents, and skills with `agent:` frontmatter execute in their assigned subagent context. Trivial edits inside an active skill workflow are still allowed.

**Three principles:**
- **Delegate first**: Offload heavy work to specialized agents
- **Conserve context**: Use the 1M context window strategically
- **Ensure accuracy**: Financial domain correctness is the top priority

## 2. Non-Goals (What Claude Must NOT Do Directly)

- Generate >10 lines of implementation code → delegate to subagent or Codex
- Edit multiple files simultaneously → use `/team-implement` for parallel work
- Read/analyze >3 files → delegate to Opus subagent
- Design complex algorithms → delegate to Codex CLI
- Analyze charts/PDFs/images → delegate to Gemini CLI
- Build large data processing logic → delegate to Codex CLI
- Read long logs/output → save to file, then analyze via subagent

## 3. Routing Policy

### Claude Opus Subagents (Codebase Work)
- Codebase exploration and structure analysis
- Lightweight code review and refactoring
- Documentation generation and updates
- Test code creation

### Codex CLI (Deep Reasoning / Design Decisions)
- Trade logic and algorithm design
- Statistical validation of backtest results
- MQL5 code review and optimization
- Bot async architecture review
- Debugging and root cause analysis
- Risk model design and verification
- Performance optimization
- Architecture design decisions
- Deployment configuration review

### Gemini CLI (Multimodal Processing)
- Chart image pattern recognition
- PDF/report data extraction
- Multi-source visual comparison analysis
- Research paper summarization
- Visualization result interpretation

### Specialized Subagents by Domain
| Agent | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| data-engineer | Market data pipelines |
| quant-analyst | Backtesting, statistics, risk |
| strategist | Trade logic, signals |
| ea-developer | MQL5 Expert Advisors |
| bot-engineer | API-based Python trading bots |
| infra-ops | Deployment, Docker, monitoring |
| codex-debugger | Error analysis via Codex |

## 4. Delegation Triggers

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Output exceeds 10 lines | Delegate to subagent or Codex |
| Editing 2+ files | Use `/team-implement` for parallel work |
| Reading 3+ files | Delegate to Opus subagent |
| Design decision needed | Codex CLI design review |
| Multimodal input | Delegate to Gemini CLI |
| Error analysis | codex-debugger subagent |
| Bot development (ccxt, WebSocket, API) | bot-engineer subagent |
| Deployment / Docker / infra | infra-ops subagent |
| Bot incident / emergency | `/incident-response` skill |

## 5. Execution Patterns

- **foreground**: Codex design review, statistical validation (wait for result, then integrate)
- **background**: Gemini research, data fetching (run in parallel)
- **save-to-file**: Large output goes to `.claude/docs/` to conserve context

## 6. Output Contract

- **Conclusion first**: TL;DR → details
- **Explicit uncertainty**: "This may...", "Confidence: High/Medium/Low"
- **Financial precision**: Prices at appropriate decimal places, metrics to 4 decimal places
- **Mandatory risk notes**: Every strategy proposal must include risk scenarios

## 7. Quality Gates

Check before responding:
1. Am I handling a task that should be delegated?
2. Is financial domain accuracy ensured?
3. Are risk-related caveats included?
4. Am I consuming context window unnecessarily?

## 8. Language Protocol

| Target | Language |
|--------|----------|
| User interaction | Japanese |
| Code and comments | English |
| Variable/function names | English (snake_case) |
| Class names | English (PascalCase) |
| Commit messages | English (Conventional Commits) |
| Documentation | Japanese (technical terms in English OK) |

## 9. Repository Conventions

- **Package manager**: uv
- **Testing**: pytest
- **Linter**: ruff
- **Type checker**: mypy
- **Formatter**: ruff format
- **MQL5**: MetaEditor compliant
- **Data format**: Parquet (large), CSV (small)

## Current Context

### 2026-05-14 — Multi-Strategy Foundation Landed

The orchestrator's skill / rule skeleton now supports multiple strategies in parallel as a first-class concern. Switching strategies no longer requires rewriting shared files.

- New rule: `.claude/rules/multi-strategy.md` (contract for `strategy_id`, MagicNumber, registry, isolation, risk aggregation)
- New skill: `/strategy-register` (only sanctioned writer of `config/registry.toml`)
- New rule addition: `.claude/rules/language.md` "No Emojis (Project-Wide)" — applies to all files and chat
- Rules updated: `coding-principles`, `risk-management`, `monitoring`, `bot-development`, `deployment`
- Skills updated: `init-finance`, `strategy-design`, `bot-develop`, `ea-generate`, `bot-deploy`, `bot-monitor`, `risk-report`
- Design record: DESIGN.md ADR-005

Defaults established:
- Identity: `<venue>.<market>.<logic_slug>.<symbol>.<timeframe>.v<major>` (e.g. `binance.swap.mean-revert.btcusdt.5m.v1`)
- Runtime: 1 strategy = 1 process / container, per-strategy SQLite, per-strategy JSONL log
- MagicNumber range: `20_000_000`-`89_999_999`, deterministic hash with salt-resolved collisions, frozen in registry
- Lifecycle: `draft -> testnet -> live -> deprecated -> retired` (no backward transitions); `/bot-deploy` is the only authorized live promoter
- Risk aggregator: separate service per `risk_group`, reconciles against venue every 60s

Outstanding follow-ups (not blocking, but should be picked up):
- Reference implementation of `src/orchestrator/registry.py` and `src/risk/aggregator.py` (currently scaffold stubs from `/init-finance`)
- CI wiring of `/strategy-register audit`
- The `check-codex-before-write.py` hook treats the auto-memory directory (`~/.claude/projects/-Users-ohayotaro-claude-finance/memory/`) as path traversal because it sits outside `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`. This blocks legitimate memory writes — needs an explicit allowlist for the memory dir.
- `/team-review` of this batch (deferred — touched 12 files, ~700+ lines)
